I am interested in problems jointly related to healthcare and artificial intelligence applications. Primarily, my research is heavily focused on breast cancer and imaging. Currently, my research interest can be summarized into three themes: 
* Development of innovative approaches with dataset involving breast cancer: Examples of this work include my recent work on [cosmesis measurement for breast cancer patients having breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy using deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417423027112) and prior work on [predicting future occurrence of breast cancer in high-risk patients](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmri.26636).
* Application and evaluation of recent deep learning-based methods in medical imaging, in close consultations with clinicians: Examples of this work include my recent work on [evaluating SAM and MedSAM for segmenting liver observations in MRI](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08465371241250215). 
* Reviewing the literature at the intersection of healthcare and AI in selected domains: Examples of this work [reviewing natural language processing for breast cancer radiology reports](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1160167/full), [reviewing machine learning for imaging in pituitary tumor patients]([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmri.26534](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11102-019-01026-x)), and [reviewing deep learning with focus on MRI](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmri.26534). 
* Bridging with clinicians, health research methodologists, healthcare researchers who are interested in working with AI, through sharing and expanding my analytical expertise.
